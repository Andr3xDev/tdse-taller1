## About
This project is a handcrafted web server, built from the ground up in pure Java without relying on any external frameworks. Instead of using pre-built tools, this server connects directly to the network to read and understand the fundamental language of the web. Itâ€™s designed to be a reliable workhorse, expertly serving static files like HTML pages, CSS stylesheets, and images right to your browser. 

Beyond just files, it's also equipped to run a simple, dynamic API, making it a versatile tool for various web tasks. This project peels back the layers of modern abstractions to show how the core conversation between a browser and a server truly works.es.
